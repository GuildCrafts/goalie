# Goalie

**Goalie** is a better goal library for the LOS. It is an ongoing, maintained `prototype` project that will have a deployed, live alpha version usable by current learners.

Goalie uses GitHub issues as its canonical data store, wrapping the issue data and providing a more useful/relevant interface to the LOS goals.

The live app is available here: https://lg-goalie.herokuapp.com/
